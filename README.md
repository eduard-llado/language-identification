# Language Identification

This repository contains some of my best submissions to the Language Identification competition, publicly available at:

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/wili5/overview

It is a classification task based on identifying the written language of some text.

This was part of the *Spoken and Written Language processing* course of the Data Science and Engineering degree at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Barcelona, Spring 2022.

The competition was in pairs and I competed with my friend Yikai, although these particular submissions were my own.

The multilingual BERT submission got us first place by a significant margin.

A large difficulty was not running out of GPU memory, the BERT model being so large.
